## 1. Abstract
* Objective   
Individual personal color analysis and custom color palette through frontal face image
* Process    
1) Classify worm tone and cool tone by ensemble model with skin color data.  
2) Diagnose 4 season types of personal color by Clustering the eye brightness extracted from 1770 face photographs.  
* Conclusion   
Improvement of accuracy and usability with a quantitative approach to the traditionally qualitative personal color diagnosis

#### Pantone Humanae Project Photo Crawling
* 'Pantone Humanae Project' dealt with the natural skin color of human along all regions of the world. The photos has high-definition and make it's overall color tone quite equal to the real tone.

* We colleted about 1770 pieces of photo from the above site for two objects.   
First, we compared the skin color extracted with the face cognition of OpenCV and the background color of Humanae Project's  face photo. So, it was proven that the two colors have almost identical values.   
Second, we made two clusters of eye brightness to make the criteria of classification.
